# Credit Risk Modeling

This project explores credit risk modeling using a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-default-risk) from [Home Credit](https://www.homecredit.net) to predict clients who are likely to have payment delinquency, with the following considerations in mind:
- Feature selection
- Data imbalance
- Compliance with federal regulations regarding protected classes
- Model fairness
